# digital_protest
A site for collecting resources and businesses to support in the black community - resist digitally


This site will serve to direct attention to businesses and organizations in communities of color who are in need of support.

The site will contain black businesses organized by state and organizations that are working to end violence and discrimination  against the black community organized by category, a wall of shame for making people aware of companies that are actively harming communities of color, and instructions for non POC allies on how they can be effective and helpful.

The site will be updated as new businesses, organizations, and resources are brought to our attention.
